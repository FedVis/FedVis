- 👋 Hi, I’m Federico from Italy 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and here to show a little of my skills,
- I'm here to have some project to show for my CV
- and I may collaborate in projects if I'm interested in, 
- I'm really interested in statistical analisys, financial markets and development of trading systems
- I've experience as system administrator, network manager, programming, web development and SQL
- About programming I always say that the foundation is to build a good algoritm then you can code it in every language you want using a manual
- 💞️ I'm good in Python and trying always to get better
- I also know Java but I'm not really interested in becoming expert unless there can be a career opportunity
